- Chat with other players on the server
- Check inventory, player position, and server information
- Advanced movement control including jumping, sneaking, and sprinting
- Entity interaction including attacking and following
- Container usage (chests, furnaces, etc.)
- Item crafting and villager trading
- Detailed inventory management
